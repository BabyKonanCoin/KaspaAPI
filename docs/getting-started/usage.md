# Usage Guide: Best Practices for API Interaction

When using the **KaspaAPI Module** to interact with the **Kaspa Explorer API** and **Kasplex API**, it‚Äôs essential to follow best practices to ensure optimal performance and maintain good standing with the API providers. Below are guidelines and a disclaimer for responsible usage.

---

## Best Practices for API Usage üåê

1. **Rate Limiting**
   - Avoid sending too many requests in a short time frame.
   - Check if the API provider specifies a maximum request rate and adhere to it.
   - Implement delays between requests if performing bulk operations.

2. **Efficient Querying**
   - Be specific in your queries to minimize the data retrieved.
   - Use filters and parameters to narrow down the results.
   - Avoid fetching unnecessary data to reduce server load.

3. **Caching Results**
   - Cache responses locally when feasible to minimize repetitive API calls.
   - For example, save snapshots of holder data or transaction results to a file for later use.

4. **Error Handling**
   - Handle API errors gracefully, such as timeouts, rate limits, or invalid responses.
   - Use try-catch blocks in PowerShell to manage exceptions effectively.

5. **Respect API Terms of Service**
   - Always comply with the API provider's terms and conditions.
   - Avoid activities such as scraping or spamming endpoints, which may lead to your access being blocked.

## Disclaimer for Users ‚ö†Ô∏è

By using the **KaspaAPI Module**, you agree to the following:

1. **No Guarantee of API Availability**
   - The module relies on third-party APIs (**Kaspa Explorer API** and **Kasplex API**) that are not under the control of this project.
   - These APIs may experience downtime, rate limits, or changes that could impact the functionality of this module.

2. **User Responsibility**
   - You are responsible for ensuring your usage complies with the terms of service of the API providers.
   - Misuse of the APIs, such as excessive requests or unauthorized activities, may lead to restricted access.

3. **Accuracy of Data**
   - The data retrieved through the APIs is provided as-is and may not always be accurate or up to date.
   - Always verify critical information independently.

4. **Liability**
   - The maintainers of the **KaspaAPI Module** are not liable for any issues arising from the use of this module, including but not limited to:
